## Prerequisites

`pygal` uses `lxml`, which has a number of dependencies, install them with:
```
apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
```

Or see http://lxml.de/installation.html

## Installation and starting

To start the chart renderer run `./start`. If the virtual environment does not exist, this will also install it.
